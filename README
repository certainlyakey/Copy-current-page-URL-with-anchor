Firefox extension that allows to right-click on an element and copy
the page URL with the element's ID, thus retaining an anchor. Useful
when you want to keep a link to specific section of a webpage.

If you click on an element which doesn't have ID attribute it will still
let you copy an anchored link of the parent section which does have it.

Works with Firefox 45+. May or may not work with other browsers.
