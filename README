Firefox extension that allows to right click on an element and copy the page URL with its ID, thus retaining an anchor. Useful if you want to keep a link to specific section of a webpage. 

If you click on an element which doesn't have ID attribute it still will let you copy an anchored link of a parent section which does have ID.

Will work starting from Firefox 35.
